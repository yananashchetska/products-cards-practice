# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Task to implement:

- Write everything in App.jsx;

- Save a selected card in the state ( don't provide a default value);

- Show the name of selected item;

- Add 'active' class to the selected card;

- Show Clear Button in the title when the item is selected;

- Basic title - "No items selected";

- Add a "Select Button" to each card (instead of choosing by a click on a card);

- "Add button" shouldn't be shown when item is selected, instead show "Remove button";

- Only one item could be selected at a time;
